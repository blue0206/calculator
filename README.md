This is the final project of The Odin Project JavaScript Foundations
curriculum. This is the toughest project I've made YET and absolutely
the most algorithm-centric. I learned a lot of things and bolstered the
concepts I didn't understand.

The biggest experience I gained from this project was that I learned how to
create events programmatically and how to dispatch them. I remember back when
I was studying this topic I didn't understand anything at all. It was tough
for me and even more so I wondered whether it would even be useful or not.
As a result, I ended up bored and half-heartedly skimmed the topic and moved
on.
However, when I was working on adding keyboard functionality to this project,
I realised how useful event constructor and event dispatch really is because 
instead of adding code for each and every key all over again, I could get the
job done with way less than half the size of code it would have required. 
As a result, I gained an interest in learning about the topic and after some
trial and error, I finally understood the mechanism behind event constructor
and event dispatch and IT WORKED SO WELL!

Another new thing I learned from this project was how to select DOM elements
based on their 'value' attributes. This topic was something I had skipped or
didn't notice back when I was studying it. So I went back and read it again
and realised it was much easier than I expected. .querySelector() sure is super
useful!

This project also helped me get a better grasp of flexbox and its properties.
I found myself reading stuff up I had already read before and got a better
understanding of the same. Even though I cannot make completely responsive
websites yet but unlike my last project (Etch-a-Sketch), this project won't
break when viewed from mobile device (though it might look a lil bit weird.)

I also found myself using array methods quite often with this project. One of
the most helpful one of those methods which I just recently learned is .some()
array method which helped me break out of a tight spot when I had to work on the
algorithm to take in user input and operate on that input and carry out the
respective calculations based on the operator entered by the user.

I always feared string manipulations but this project gave me a big push in getting
over that fear. 
I also feared that I didn't understand array and string methods like .join(), 
Array.from(), .split(), .includes(), etc. but this project pushed me to use them and 
made me realise how useful they really are.

This project was a major experience for me and thanks to it, I'm confident that I can
tackle more advanced concepts of Web Development.
